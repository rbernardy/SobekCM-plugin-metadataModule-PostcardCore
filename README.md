# SobekCM-plugin-metadataModule-PostcardCore
<p>SobekCM-plugin-metadataModule-PostcardCore is a plugin for the open-source <a href="https://github.com/MarkVSullivan/SobekCM-Web-Application">SobekCM</a> Digital Repository software (<a href="https://github.com/MarkVSullivan">Mark V. Sullivan</a>, lead developer). It provides a custom metadata module supporting a descriptive metadata scheme used by USF Libraries Digital Collections for postcards.</p>
<p>Development of this plugin began after receiving excellent training from Mark Sullivan at the Spring 2015 SobekCM Code Camp in Miami, Florida. Mark also finalized the plugin project by making adjustments to it to make it compatible with the updated plugin system in the 4.10.0 release.</p>
